          • AdyenCLI Development: Engineered AdyenCLI, a Golang-based command-line interface (CLI) application serving as a platform for executing plugins developed in Java, Go, Bash, and Python. Utilizing gRPC, I ensured secure and permission-based interactions with these plugins, facilitating seamless execution on user laptops.

          • High Availability Deployment: Deployed AdyenCLI across four distinct Kubernetes clusters in different regions, managing DNS with HashiCorp Consul to direct requests to the nearest healthy service. This setup, combined with JFrog for federated plugin serving, achieved 99.999% availability globally.

          • Workflow Automation with Argo: Designed and implemented highly available workflows using Kubernetes and Argo Workflows. By integrating Kubernetes' leader election mechanism with Argo CD and Argo Events, I established a system that ensures continuous workflow execution across multiple clusters, maintaining 99.999% availability.

          • Code Journey Project: Developed Code Journey, a system that aggregates data from GitLab, Jenkins, and other CI/CD tools, along with logs and metrics, storing them in a NoSQL database. This platform empowers developers to monitor critical data for merge requests and trace code changes post-deployment.

          • Contribution Automation Development: Created a GitLab merge request and pipeline management system that receives GitLab webhooks and utilizes the GitLab API to update merge requests. This system interacts with services like Jenkins and Mattermost, allowing users to define specific workflows per repository, such as assigning reviewers, running pipelines, notifying developers, and analyzing code changes.
          
          Tech stack: 

          • Programming Languages: Proficient in Golang, Python, Shell, and PHP, with extensive experience in developing secure and efficient applications.          
          
          • Infrastructure and Cloud Technologies: Experienced with private cloud environments, including OpenStack, and proficient in using Terraform for infrastructure as code.          
          
          • Containerization and Orchestration: Skilled in deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and scalability.          
          
          • Secret Management: Utilized HashiCorp Vault for secure storage and management of sensitive information.
          
          • CI/CD Tools: Experienced with GitLab for version control and CI/CD pipelines, and JFrog for artifact management.
          
          • Workflow Automation: Proficient in using Argo Workflows, Argo Events, and Argo CD for automating and managing complex workflows in Kubernetes environments.
          
          • Monitoring and Observability: Implemented systems for aggregating and analyzing logs and metrics to provide insights into application performance and health.
